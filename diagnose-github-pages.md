# GitHub Pages Deployment Diagnosis

## Current Status
Your GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured and commits are being pushed successfully. However, GitHub Pages is still showing the README.md file instead of your Next.js application.

## Most Likely Issue
Based on common GitHub Pages deployment problems, the issue is likely one of the following:

### 1. GitHub Pages Source Not Set to GitHub Actions
**This is the most common cause of this issue.**

To fix this:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/KingEndubis/Xbon
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, make sure it's set to **"Deploy from a branch"** and change it to **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Save the changes

### 2. GitHub Actions May Be Disabled
If GitHub Actions are disabled for your repository:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/KingEndubis/Xbon
2. Click on **Actions** tab
3. If you see "Actions are disabled", click **"Enable Actions"**

### 3. Workflow Permissions Issue
If the workflow runs but fails to deploy:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select **"Read and write permissions"**
3. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

## How to Verify the Fix

1. After making the above changes, trigger a new deployment by making a small change:
   ```bash
   # Add a comment to trigger deployment
   echo "// Trigger deployment $(date)" >> apps/web/src/app/page.tsx
   git add apps/web/src/app/page.tsx
   git commit -m "Trigger deployment: $(date)"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Check the Actions tab to see if the workflow runs successfully

3. Wait 5-10 minutes and visit: https://kingendubis.github.io/Xbon/

## Alternative: Manual Deployment Check

If the above doesn't work, you can manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **"Deploy Next.js site to Pages"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select the **master** branch and click **"Run workflow"**

## Expected Result
After fixing the Pages source setting, your site should show your Next.js application instead of the README.md file.

## Technical Details
- Your local build works correctly ✅
- Your workflow configuration is correct ✅
- Your commits are being pushed successfully ✅
- The issue is likely in the GitHub Pages configuration ❌
